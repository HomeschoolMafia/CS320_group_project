# project_proposer
Group Project for CS320

# Install
Run the command:
```
python3 -m pip install path_to_project
```


# Run the program
Run the command:
```prototype_server```
When you do, the main function of the script at project_proposer/scripts/prototype_server.py runs.
If everything is working correctly, after running that commmand, you should be able to open a browser
and type
```
localhost:5000/user/login
```
This should display the login page. From there, you can navigate to every page of the website
